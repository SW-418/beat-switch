# Beat Switch

Full stack application using React/NextJS/TypeScript.

Playing around with Music APIs. I'm trying out Apple Music after a long time on Spotify.

Currently requires Spotify API key (client id) which can be created via the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

Current functionality:
- Generate Spotify playlist from top tracks
- Generate Spotify playlist from saved tracks

Future functionality:
- Transfer playlist from Spotify to Apple Music
- Transfer saved songs from Spotify to Apple Music

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn
```

## Development

```bash
# Start development server
yarn dev
```
